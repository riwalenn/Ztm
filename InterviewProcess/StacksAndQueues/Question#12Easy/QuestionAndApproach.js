/*
    Implement the class Queue using stacks.
    The queue methods you need to implement are enqueue, dequeue, peek, empty.
    Enqueue : append a value to the end of the queue.
    Dequeue : Remove and the value at the start of the queue.
    Peek : return the value at the start of the queue.
    Empty : return a boolean value of whether the queue is empty or not.

    Step 1 : Verify the constraints
    - Do the queue methods we have to implement need to perform at the same complexity of a real queue ?  No, but they should be as performant as possible.

    Step 4 : Write out our solution in code
