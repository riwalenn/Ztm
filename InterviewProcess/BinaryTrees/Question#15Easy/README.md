Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
Maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path
from the root node to the furthest leaf node.

### Step 1 : Verify the constraints
- What do we return if the tree is empty ? Return 0.
- What do we return if the tree have 1 node ? Return 1.

### Step 4 : Write out our solution in code
