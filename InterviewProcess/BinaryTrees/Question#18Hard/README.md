Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

### Step 1 : Verify the constraints
- What do we return if the tree is empty ? Return 0.

### Step 4 : Write some tests cases
- with three levels of nodes
  - if every row is full => return 15
  - if every row is full but the last one have 1 node => return 8
  - if every row is full but the last one have some nodes (5) => return 12

### Step 4 : Write out our solution in code
