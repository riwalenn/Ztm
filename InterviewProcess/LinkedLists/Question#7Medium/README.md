Given a linked list and numbers m and n,
return it back with only positions m to n reverse.
list = [1,2,3,4,5]; m = 2; n = 4; result =  [1,4,3,2,5]

### Step 1 : Verify the constraints
- Will m and n always be within the bounds of the linked list ? Yes, assume 1 <= m <= n <= length of linked list.
- Can we receive m and n values for the whole linked list ? Yes, we can receive m = 1 and n = length of linked list.

### Step 2 : Write out some test cases
- list = [1,2,3,4,5]; m = 2; n = 4; result = [1,4,3,2,5]
- list = [1,2,3,4,5]; m = 1; n = 5; result = [5,4,3,2,1]
- list = [5]; m = 1; n = 1; result = 1
- list = []; m = 1; n = 1; result = 0
